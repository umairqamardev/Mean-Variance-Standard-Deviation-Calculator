# Mean-Variance-Standard-Deviation-Calculator

Overview:

This project is a calculator that computes the mean, variance, and standard deviation of a given list of numbers. The goal was to build a simple but effective tool to analyze data sets.

Features:

Mean Calculation: Computes the arithmetic average of a list of numbers.
Variance Calculation: Measures the spread of data points from the mean.
Standard Deviation: Measures the amount of variation in the data.
Technologies Used:

Python
Jupyter Notebook (for implementation)
